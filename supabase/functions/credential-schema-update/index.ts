 * This is an example of a database migration function that would update
 * the credential_access_log table to support cloud secret manager integration.
 * 
 * In practice, this would be implemented as SQL migrations directly in Supabase.
 * 
 * ALTER TABLE public.credential_access_log
 * ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS metadata JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

// Note: This file serves as documentation for what SQL would be needed.
// The actual migration should be executed through SQL in the Supabase dashboard.
